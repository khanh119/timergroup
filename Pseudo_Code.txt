PRINT "Players stand."

GENERATE a random number between 10 and 25 and STORE it in 'sleep_time'.

PRINT "The program is now sleeping. Players can sit down."

SLEEP for 'sleep_time' seconds (pause the program).

INITIALIZE an empty list called 'sat_down' to track players who sat down.

DISPLAY the "Time's Up" image.

WHILE True:
    PROMPT the user to input a player's name who sat down.
    
    IF the user presses Enter without entering a name:
        BREAK out of the loop.
    
    OTHERWISE:
        ADD the player's name to the 'sat_down' list.

IF the 'sat_down' list is NOT empty:
    SET 'winner' to the last name in the 'sat_down' list.
    PRINT "<winner> is the last person to sit down and is the winner!"

OTHERWISE:
    PRINT "No one sat down!"

END the game.
